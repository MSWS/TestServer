# TestServer
Test Server is a personal project of mine to help with my testing, creation, and management of Minecraft Plugins.

The current features are full world management through a fun GUI, a custom easier /fill command, and a /testworld command which allows you to easily create new worlds. You are also able to view and manage entities with /test entities, worlds with /test worlds, and gamerules with /gamerules <World>. 

There is also a /forcefield command for funsies.
